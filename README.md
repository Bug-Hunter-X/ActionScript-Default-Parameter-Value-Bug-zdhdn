This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in ActionScript related to default parameter values.  The issue arises when a function with default parameters is called with fewer arguments than declared. ActionScript's handling of this situation can be inconsistent and may lead to unexpected behavior. The `bug.as` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.as` provides a corrected version that addresses the issue.
